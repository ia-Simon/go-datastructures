# go-datastructures

This repository is a sandbox for implementations of all kinds of data structures in the Go Programming Language.

Each package under [structures](./structures/) contains a tested implementation of a specific data structure, along with common use-cases for that structure.

The majority of the structures are implemented using linked list-like structures, purely for study purposes. Linear structures such as queues and stacks should generally be implemented using arrays or slices, since this kind of base container works better with modern day processor cache memory.
